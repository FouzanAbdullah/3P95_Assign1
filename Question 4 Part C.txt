C) Assess the effectiveness of the test cases from part A by using mutation analysis in conjunction with the mutated codes from part B. Rank the test-cases and explain your answer. 

	Test case 1: Normal case
  o	Mutation version 1 (Introducing a syntax error): Detects the syntax error introduced by missing a closing quotation mark.
  o	Mutated version 2 (Changing arithmetic operation): Detects the change in arithmetic operation.
  o	Mutated version 3 (Changing loop condition): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 4 (Modifying exception handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 5 (Altering arithmetic operations): Detects the change in arithmetic operations.
  o	Mutated version 6 (Exception list handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.

	Test case 2: Empty data list
  o	Mutation version 1 (Introducing a syntax error): Detects the syntax error introduced by missing a closing quotation mark.
  o	Mutated version 2 (Changing arithmetic operation): Detects the change in arithmetic operation.
  o	Mutated version 3 (Changing loop condition): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 4 (Modifying exception handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 5 (Altering arithmetic operations): Detects the change in arithmetic operations.
  o	Mutated version 6 (Exception list handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.

	Test case 3: Exception case
  o	Mutated version 1 (Introducing a syntax error): Detects the syntax error introduced by missing a closing quotation mark.
  o	Mutated version 2 (Changing arithmetic operation): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 3 (Changing loop condition): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 4 (Modifying exception handling): Detects the change in exception handling.
  o	Mutated version 5 (Altering arithmetic aperations): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 6 (Exception list handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.

	Test case 4: Mixed data types
  o	Mutated version 1 (Introducing a syntax error): Detects the syntax error introduced by missing a closing quotation mark.
  o	Mutated version 2 (Changing arithmetic operation): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 3 (Changing loop condition): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 4 (Modifying exception handling): Detects the change in exception handling.
  o	Mutated version 5 (Altering arithmetic operations): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.
  o	Mutated version 6 (Exception list handling): Doesn't detect the mutation as it focuses on a different aspect of the code.

Ranking:
  1.	Test Case 1 (Normal case): This test case effectively detected mutations related to syntax errors and changes in arithmetic operations. It ranks highest due to its ability to uncover different types of mutations.
  2.	Test Case 2 (Empty data list): Like Test Case 1, it effectively detected syntax errors and changes in arithmetic operations, ranking second.
  3.	Test Case 3 (Mixed data types): This test case detected the syntax error but had limited effectiveness in detecting other mutations, ranking third.
  4.	Test Case 4 (Exception case): This test case had limited effectiveness in detecting mutations and ranked the lowest.
