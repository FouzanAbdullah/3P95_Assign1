B) Explain and provide detailed steps for “random testing” the above code. No need to run any code, just present the coding strategy or describe your testing method in detail. (8 + 8 = 16 pts) 

•	Step 1: Understand the Code:
  o	Before conducting random testing, you need a good understanding of the code you're testing. You should be aware of the purpose of the code, its input requirements, expected behavior, and potential edge cases or failure points.

•	Step 2: Identify Inputs and Boundaries
  o	Identify the inputs required by the code:
    	data: A list of data elements.
    	limit: A numeric limit.
    	exceptions: A list of exceptions.
  o	Understand the boundaries of the input space, such as the range of possible data elements and the numeric range for limit.

•	Step 3: Generate Random Inputs
  o	Generate random inputs within the defined input space. In this case, it includes generating random lists of data, random limit values, and random lists of exceptions.
  o	Ensure that your generated inputs cover a wide range of possibilities, including edge cases like empty lists and extreme values for limit.

•	Step 4: Execute the Code
  o	Run the filterData function with the randomly generated inputs. Ensure that you capture the results for further analysis.
  o	If the code crashes, raises exceptions, or exhibits unexpected behavior, make note of it.

•	Step 5: Evaluate the Outputs
  o	Examine the output generated by the code for each set of random inputs.
  o	Compare the results to your expectations based on the code's logic.

•	Step 6: Check for Failures and Anomalies
  o	Identify any discrepancies between the expected and actual outcomes.
  o	Look for potential issues like incorrect results, exceptions, or crashes.

•	Step 7: Iterative Testing
  o	Repeat the process with multiple sets of random inputs to increase the chances of identifying issues.
  o	Modify the input parameters iteratively, including edge cases and boundary values.

•	Step 8: Edge Cases Testing
  o	Specifically, test the code with edge cases, such as empty lists, large data sets, and extreme values for limit.

•	Step 9: Documentation
  o	Document the issues, anomalies, and discrepancies found during random testing.
  o	Provide a clear description of the inputs that triggered issues and the unexpected behaviors observed.
